ABSTRACT	
	
This file records data for cottonwood tree growth, sex, and survival at	
Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (BEMP) sites in the Middle Rio	
Grande Valley of Central New Mexico, USA.  This is a citizen-based 	
monitoring program designed to provide ecological data needed for	
management of the riparian forest, as well as to provide citizens with	
a better understanding of and appreciation for this threatened	
ecosystem.  Cottonwoods were monitored at each site to provide	
information on existing size, growth and survial of this dominant	
riparian tree species.  Data collection was begun in 1998 at four	
sites in the valley.

WHY THE DATA WERE COLLECTED	
	
These data were collected to provide information on the existing size, sex,	
growth and survival of the dominant riparian tree, _Populus deltoides_	
subspp. _wislizenii_.  Data can be compared among the different BEMP	
sites to assess the size and condition of cottonwoods along the Middle	
Rio Grande Valley.	
	
	
WHEN THE DATA WERE COLLECTED	
	
Data are collected in the spring of each year, generally in April and May.

WHO COLLECTED THE DATA	
	
The Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program is a collaborative effort between 	
the University of New Mexico, the National Science Foundation LTER 	
Schoolyard Habitats Program, Bosque Preparatory School, and a number of 	
other schools and citizen-based volunteer groups in the Middle Rio Grande 	
Valley of central New Mexico.  Data are available to any interested parties.  	
Data are housed at the University of New Mexico via the Sevilleta Information 	
Management System.
