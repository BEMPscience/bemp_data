Community Science, Education, and Stewardship: Equitable and inclusive hands-on student research essential to the management of the Rio Grande ecosystem.

The Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (bemp.org) collects core monitoring data on a monthly basis at each of our 33 sites with our community science members.  

Our core community science datasets are: 

    Depth to groundwater  
    Leaf litterfall 
    Precipitation 
    Depth to water in the nearby ditch
    Surface active arthropods

BEMP also collects the following data sets:<br>
Vegetation surveys at the centimeter scale<br>
Woody debris for fuel load calculations<br>
Diameter at breast height for cottonwood trees<br>
Water quality on the Rio Grande<br>
Pressure transducer data from the shallow riparian aquifer<br>
Temperature data logger<br>

BEMP science and education take place on current and ancestral lands of the Pueblo, Din√© (Navajo), Apache, and other displaced Indigenous Peoples.

BEMP is a partnership between the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research Station and the University of New Mexico Department of Biology. The primary start funding for the Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program came from the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DEB-9420510, Amendment No. 004, 1997) through the Univeristy of New Mexico Department of Biology.
