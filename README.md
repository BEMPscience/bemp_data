# BEMP community science data

Community Science, Education, and Stewardship: Equitable and inclusive hands-on student research essential to the management of the Rio Grande ecosystem.

The Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (bemp.org) collects core monitoring data on a monthly basis at each of our 33 sites with our community science members.  

Our core datasets are: 

    Depth to groundwater  
    Leaf litterfall 
    Precipitation 
    Depth to water in the nearby ditch 

Five wells at each site are used to measure depth to groundwater, which play a critical role in cottonwood and other vegetation health and are also important to understanding water cycle and evapotranspiration dynamics. 

Precipitation is monitored using two gauges, one located in an open area and one under the forest canopy. Oil is placed in the gauge to limit loss of water to evaporation. 

A rubber tub is placed at the center of each of the ten vegetation transects to collect leaf litter fall. In the lab, leaves, wood, and reproductive parts of the ten most common canopy and shrub species are dried, sorted, and identified. This dataset is useful in evaluating net primary productivity, native and exotic species composition, and can provide early indicators of plant stress before mortality occurs (eg, leaf drop in summer). 

BEMP also collects the following data sets:<br>
Vegetation surveys at the centimeter scale<br>
Woody debris for fuel load calculations<br>
Diameter at breast height for cottonwood trees<br>
Surface active arthropod collections<br> 
Water quality on the Rio Grande<br>
Pressure transducer data from the shallow riparian aquifer<br>
Temperature data logger<br>
