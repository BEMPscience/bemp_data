Community Science, Education, and Stewardship: Equitable and inclusive hands-on student research essential to the management of the Rio Grande ecosystem.

The Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (bemp.org) collects core monitoring data on a monthly basis at each of our 33 sites with our community science members.  

Our core community science datasets are: 

    Depth to groundwater  
    Leaf litterfall 
    Precipitation 
    Depth to water in the nearby ditch
    Surface active arthropods

BEMP also collects the following data sets:<br>
Vegetation surveys at the centimeter scale<br>
Woody debris for fuel load calculations<br>
Diameter at breast height for cottonwood trees<br>
Water quality on the Rio Grande<br>
Pressure transducer data from the shallow riparian aquifer<br>
Temperature data logger<br>
