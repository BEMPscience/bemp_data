### Purpose
A key issue for Rio Grande water quality within Albuquerque is that, for the majority of the city (east of the river), precipitation and storm runoff drain into the North Diversion Channel, which flows into a ponding area before emptying into the Rio Grande at the north end of the city. The North Diversion Channel storm flows enter the Rio Grande above the intake for the Drinking Water Project Diversion Dam. Since 2008 Albuquerque has been using surface water (in addition to groundwater) for drinking water; contaminants in the river above the drinking water project diversion dam should be of interest to the City of Albuquerque officials, the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority, and residents of Albuquerque.
