2021 sample sites map showing the complex interactions of streets, drains, arroyos, and landscape. 

### Purpose
The Albuquerque metro area is New Mexico’s largest city in terms of population (916,528 according to the 2020 United States Census Bureau estimate) and land area. It accounts for 61% percent of the state’s population and 53% of employment. As the largest urban area in the state, Albuquerque faces many water quality issues with far-reaching impacts. The Middle Rio Grande, a primary contact stream (State of New Mexico Standards), is used by swimmers, boaters, fishermen, irrigators, and wildlife. Fishing is also encouraged in the nearby ditches, which are often stocked. When the water quality of the Middle Rio Grande is considered, both river water and ditch water quality need to be monitored, as both have a direct impact on water users (e.g., recreation users, irrigators, fishermen).
