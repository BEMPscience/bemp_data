## Water chemistry of the ditch, river, and BEMP wells
This data contains: turbidity (NTU),	DO (mg/L),	Do (%),	Temp (C),	Specific Conductance (uS/cm),	Conductivity (uS),	Temp (C),	pH,
Chloride (mg/L),	Bromide (mg/L),	Nitrate-N (mg/L),	Phosphate-P (mg/L),	Sulfate (mg/L),	and NH4-N (mg/L).

Ditch, river, and wells were sampled as closely as possible together.

Chloride and Bromide ratios are often used as indicators of water quality and spatial and temporal geochemical processes.
